What do all our bots do?

I receive a lot this question, so i am going to give u a quick answer as the functions are very extensive.

Farming bots are trending and it is what all devs and traders are using to run their strategies and take advantage of the memecoin space.

Example 1:

 You can launch a coin on pumpfun and snipe 20% supply with different wallets without the bubble map linking all the wallets to your dev wallet; With this strategy people will start buying after you and the selling pressure will be low as u hold a large amount of supply and it will be easier to reach KOTH or Raydium.  

Whenever you decide you can rug and dump all your bags profiting masively or just sell slowly.

You can repeat this process as many times as you want and make a lot of money if u know how to time it! You can farm other peoples projects too not only yours.

Example 2:

This is for advanced users and its how big money is made.

1️⃣ You launch a coin on pumpfun and snipe 80% supply with +100 wallets, the coin will go in couple minutes to Ray as the bonding curve is almost complete and u will drag people's attention when u reach KOTH.

2️⃣ When the coin is on Ray the price will skyrocket as long as u don't sell big amounts as u hold majority of supply and u can control the selling presure; If you don't sell the price will just keep raising.

3️⃣ You can run a Volume Bot to create millions in fake volume to be trending on Dextools and Dexscreener attracting everyone's attention and also create as many fake holders as you want. You are basically getting free marketing on the most important memecoin websites!

4️⃣ Rug or sell slowly whenever you want and enjoy your profits!
